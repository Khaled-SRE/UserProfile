# 🏗️ Microservices High-Level Architecture

![System Overview](high-level-design-banner.png)

This repository outlines a microservices-based architecture that encapsulates core business functionalities including **authentication**, **profile management**, **payments**, **subscriptions**, **chat**, and **notifications**. The design emphasizes modularity, scalability, and observability with robust security measures.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **PHP (Laravel)**
- **Kubernetes** (service orchestration)
- **Redis** (caching)
- **WebSockets** (real-time chat)
- **ELK, Prometheus, Jaeger** (observability)

---

## 📁 Packages Used

```json
"fakerphp/faker": "^1.23",
"laravel/pail": "^1.2.2",
"laravel/pint": "^1.13",
"laravel/sail": "^1.41",
"mockery/mockery": "^1.6",
"nunomaduro/collision": "^8.6",
"phpunit/phpunit": "^11.5.3"
````

## 📚 Project Structure

Each microservice follows a clean architecture style:

```
/services
  /auth
  /profile
  /payment
  /subscription
  /chat
  /notification

/shared
  /contracts
  /events
  /utils
```

* **Service Layer**: Business logic
* **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction
* **Observer Layer**: Event-driven state changes

---

## 🔐 Security

* Centralized JWT auth via **Auth Service**
* All microservices protected via **API Gateway**
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* mTLS for service-to-service communication

---

## 🌐 Core Microservices

### 🧩 Auth Service

* Manages login, registration, and token issuance
* Handles OAuth2 and refresh token flow
* Validates tokens for API Gateway and other services

### 👤 Profile Service

* Manages user metadata (e.g., name, avatar, settings)
* Caching using Redis for fast reads

### 💳 Payment Service

* Integrates with payment gateways
* Generates and stores invoices/receipts

### 📦 Subscription Service

* Manages plan lifecycle
* Consumes payment events to activate/renew plans

### 💬 Chat Service

* Real-time user-to-user messaging
* Message persistence

### 🔔 Notification Service

* Sends email/SMS/push notifications
* Listens to events like `chat.message.sent`, `payment.successful`
* Pluggable providers

---

## 🚪 API Gateway

* Handles authentication and routing
* Validates JWT tokens with Auth Service
* Enforces rate limiting and access control

---


### 🔗 API Calls (Synchronous)

Used when immediate feedback is needed.

* `GetUserProfile`
* `CreateSubscription`
* `GenerateInvoice`

---

## ⚡ Redis-Based Caching

Used for fast, synchronous reads of semi-static data:

* `GET profile:{user_id}`
* `SET profile:{user_id}` on update
* `DEL profile:{user_id}` on deletion
* TTLs to keep data fresh

---

## 📈 Observability

* **Logs**: Centralized with **ELK**
* **Metrics**: Exported to **Prometheus**
* **Dashboards**: Built with **Grafana**
* **Tracing**: Via **Jaeger/OpenTelemetry**

---

## 🚀 Deployment

* All services containerized (Docker)
* Managed via **Kubernetes**
* Secrets via **K8s Secrets** or **Vault**
* Horizontal autoscaling enabled

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

* **Unit Tests** with PHPUnit
* **Mocking** via Mockery
* **Integration Tests** across service boundaries
* Contract and Consumer-Driven Tests (CDC) recommended

---

## 🔧 Dev Tools

* `Laravel Sail`: Local dev environment
* `Laravel Pint`: Code style enforcement
* `Laravel Pail`: Debugging logs & profiling
* `Nunomaduro/Collision`: Enhanced error reporting

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Add MFA to Auth Service
* API Key support for 3rd parties
* Extend notification service with delivery reports

---

## 💡 Suggested Next Steps

1. Add system diagram (include microservices, databases, and message flows)
3. Clarify internal DNS/service discovery method
4. Detail rate-limiting strategies per route/client type
5. Include a CI/CD workflow outline (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, etc.)

---

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-feature`)
5. Create a pull request
